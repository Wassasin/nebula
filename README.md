Playing with Volumetric Particle Clouds and Raycasting in OpenGL and C++11

Goal
====
For this project, I've set the endgoal to be able to render the following:

![Infinity Nebulae by iNovae studios](http://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/68643609/disp/a3e4dd1c352efbe6a68c3ef839274444.jpg)

Approach
========
* Start with a basic OpenGL renderer.
* Implement raycasting as described in [this tutorial by Peter Triers](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~trier/?page_id=98).
* Implement lighting in this Raycasting context.
* Play with [Perlin Noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) and [Strange Attractors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_attractors) to recreate the particle-patterns as in the example above.
